\title{Network-Regularized Regression Models}
\description{
\emph{netReg} fits linear regression models using network-regularization.
Network-regularization used graph prior as penality for the coefficients of linear models.
The graph can represent any relationship between the covariables/responses of the
model, for instance, some quantifiable biological relationship such as coexpression.
}
\details{
\emph{netReg} uses \emph{Armadillo} and \emph{TensorFlow} for
fast matrix computations and optimization.
